This project implements a MAGES engine game launcher (compatible with `Launcher.exe`) that can additionally configure LanguageBarrier, check for patch updates and is adapted to our Brand Identity.

The source code is **game- and patch-specific**. You will have to fork it and change a bunch of things if you want to use this for your own patches.
